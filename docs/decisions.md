# Decision log

Short ADRs. Add new entries at the bottom; never rewrite accepted ones, supersede them instead.

### ADR-001: Godot 4.7.2 (.NET) + C# on .NET 10
**Status**: accepted (2026-10-15)
Latest stable Godot with C# support. `Godot.NET.Sdk` 4.7.2 builds against `net10.0`, so one runtime
is used across core, tests and apps. Upgrade to 4.8 once it ships stable.

### ADR-002: Three tiers, engine-free core
**Status**: accepted
Core (no Godot) → Godot libraries → apps. Core rules are testable in milliseconds and reusable for
AI simulation, servers and tools. Enforced in `Directory.Build.targets`.

### ADR-003: Custom synchronous pub/sub instead of a library (MediatR, Rx, Godot signals)
**Status**: accepted
Requirements are narrow (deterministic order, breadth-first re-entrancy, lifetime-scoped
subscriptions) and must be engine-agnostic. Godot signals would leak the engine into core; MediatR/Rx add
async/threading semantics we don't want. ~100 lines, fully tested. See [event-system.md](event-system.md).

### ADR-004: Separate Godot projects per app, assets shared via links
**Status**: accepted, revisit after Phase 0 spike
User-facing apps stay independent (own settings, renderer, export presets). Shared assets live once in
`EternalWars.Godot.Assets` and are linked as `res://shared`.
*Alternative considered*: a single Godot project with three main scenes (simpler asset sharing, one
import cache) that splits apps with export feature tags. Still viable if links prove painful.

### ADR-005: Square adventure grid; square combat grid with multi-cell units
**Status**: accepted (2026-10-15)
The adventure map uses a square grid with 8-way movement (as in HoMM3). Battles use a **separate
battlefield** with a fine **square cell grid**: creature stacks occupy 2×2, 3×3 or 4×4 cells by size
class. This replaces HoMM3's hex grid. Size becomes a real tactical property (blocking, surround,
reach), and one coordinate type serves both map and battle maths.
Consequences: combat pathfinding has to test footprint clearance (precompute clearance maps per
size), and AI and UI must handle footprints rather than single cells.

### ADR-006: Text-friendly map format
**Status**: accepted
`*.ewmap.json` with terrain stored as one string per row so maps can be reviewed and merged in git.
Versioned via `formatVersion`.

### ADR-007: Code-first Godot nodes in libraries
**Status**: accepted, pending Phase 0 spike
Library node classes are instantiated from code and configured through `Bind(...)`. Avoids Godot's
`res://` script-path requirement for scripts in referenced assemblies.

### ADR-008: HoMM-inspired, not a clone; dark-fantasy realistic presentation
**Status**: accepted (2026-10-15)
We keep HoMM3's loop and structure but take deliberate departures, logged in game-design.md §8.
Art: realistic lighting and PBR materials, dark and grim atmosphere, recognisable nods to the
original. Modes in priority order: single-player vs AI, hot-seat, story campaign. Online multiplayer is
out of scope.

### ADR-009: Initiative orders turns, one action per round
**Status**: accepted (2026-10-15)
Each combat round every stack acts exactly once, ordered by an Initiative stat (separate from Speed).
HoMM5's timeline UI without its "fast units act twice". This keeps the round structure that spells
and morale reason about, while Initiative stays a tuning lever separate from movement.

### ADR-010: Town roster in four groups; two non-playable towns
**Status**: accepted (2026-10-15)
Playable: Haven, Sylvan, Academy | Necropolis, Inferno, Dungeon | Stronghold, Swamp Bestiary.
Non-playable (campaign/neutral): Conflux, Dragon Utopia. Balancing effort goes to the 8 playable towns
only. Data model: a town definition carries `Group` and `IsPlayable` so map setup, random maps and the
AI can filter on them.

### ADR-011: Smooth terrain over a logical square grid
**Status**: accepted (2026-10-15)
Rendering: heightmapped, splat-textured terrain. Logic: unchanged `AdventureMap` tiles. The map
format will grow a height/decoration layer that is purely visual. Core never reads it.

### ADR-012: Map objects = data definitions + per-kind instance classes
**Status**: accepted (2026-10-15)
Definitions (footprint, kind parameters) are data: built-in defaults in code, overridable/extendable
from JSON, which keeps the door open for modding. Behaviour is selected by `MapObjectKind` and lives in
`MapObjectInteractionService`. A plugin/behaviour registry is deferred until there are many kinds.

### ADR-013: Visiting is mandatory; routes end at entrances
**Status**: accepted (2026-10-15)
Stepping onto an entrance always visits the object, so the pathfinder never routes *through* one.
Gates are the exception: the route continues from the partner gate. Pathfinding state is
(tile, arrived-by-teleport) so a gate exit can be walked away from without bouncing back.

### ADR-014: Choices are pending decisions, not callbacks
**Status**: accepted (2026-10-15)
When a rule needs player input, it stores a `PendingDecision` in `GameState` and publishes
`DecisionRequested`. Movement and End Turn are refused until it is resolved. The core never
blocks or calls back into the UI; AI, UI and future network/replay resolve decisions the same way.
They will become commands in Phase 2.

### ADR-015: Editor edits are undoable commands over a scenario GameState
**Status**: accepted (2026-10-15)
The editor edits the same `GameState` type the game starts from. This avoids a second map model.
Each edit is an execute/undo closure pair recorded in `UndoHistory`. Commands publish domain events,
so editor views reuse game views.

### ADR-016: Fog of war is per-player permanent shroud (provisional)
**Status**: superseded by ADR-017
Matches HoMM3. Stored in `GameState.Fog`, updated by `VisibilityService` reacting to movement events.
Re-fogging would add a "currently visible" layer computed from heroes, towns and mines.

### ADR-017: Fog mode is chosen per game; refog uses hysteresis
**Status**: accepted (2026-10-15)
`GameOptions.FogMode` is set at game creation and stored in `GameState` (it is a game rule, not
map data). `PermanentReveal` = HoMM3. `ShroudWithRefog` keeps terrain and objects explored, but other
players' units are only visible on tiles in sight. A tile enters sight within an observer's radius and
leaves only beyond radius + `RefogMargin`, so units at the edge of vision don't flicker. Sight is a
pure function of current observers and is recomputed per affected player, stored as a set (cheap even
on 256×256 maps). The planner ignores unseen heroes; real movement bumps into them.

### ADR-018: HoMM3 movement rules
**Status**: accepted (2026-10-15)
A step costs the terrain being left (×1.41 diagonally). Any positive remainder allows one last step.
Daily points come from the slowest creature's speed (HoMM3 table), then a percentage bonus (skills),
then a flat bonus (artifacts), recomputed at the owner's turn start (`MovementAllowance`). Until
armies exist `Hero.SlowestCreatureSpeed` is a stored placeholder; Phase 2 derives it from the army.

### ADR-019: Six resources
**Status**: accepted (2026-10-15)
Gold, lumber, ore, crystal, mercury, sulfur. No gems. Rare resources are crystal, mercury and sulfur.

### ADR-020: Map size presets up to 256, max 8 players
**Status**: accepted (2026-10-15)
Square presets 48, 72, 96, 128, 160, 192, 256 (`MapSizes`); `AdventureMap` rejects dimensions above
256 and `GameState` more than 8 players. Data structures were checked for 256×256×2 levels: pathfinding
arrays are ~260k entries per search; fog sight is set-based.

### ADR-021: Combat ground rules
**Status**: accepted (2026-10-15)
- Battlefield 24 cells tall × 28–36 wide, set by the hero's Tactics skill (default 30).
- No facing and no generic flanking bonus. Engagement (which enemies are adjacent, on how many sides)
  and per-round hit counts are tracked so **creature abilities** can use them.
- HoMM3 Wait (end of round, reverse initiative order) and ties (attacker side, then speed, then a
  seeded roll).
- Breath has HoMM3 friendly fire; cleave/multi-head hits enemies only; only the primary target retaliates.

### ADR-022: Strategy camera
**Status**: accepted (2026-10-15)
Tilt 15–30° from vertical, coupled to zoom (zoomed in = 30°, zoomed out = 15°); rotation limited to ±45°
around the vertical axis, so the map never appears upside down and art can assume a "south-ish"
viewing direction; zoom and pan. Implemented in `StrategyCamera` (Godot.Shared), not yet verified in Godot.

### ADR-023: Standalone editor; template-based random maps in both game and editor
**Status**: accepted (2026-10-15)
The map editor stays a separate app. Random maps are generated from **templates** (HotA-style zone
graphs: zones with towns, richness, treasure and monster strength, plus guarded connections). Templates
are authored in the editor's template editor. The game generates from any available template on its
new-game screen; the editor generates into an editable map. Generation lives in a new engine-free
project `EternalWars.Core.Generation`, is deterministic from its inputs, and outputs a plain
`MapDocument`, so generated and hand-made maps share one pipeline.

### ADR-024: Terrain classes and HoMM3-style roads
**Status**: accepted (2026-10-15); per-terrain assignment pending
Every terrain belongs to a class:
- **Open**: no penalty for anyone.
- **Rough**: a fixed penalty for all factions (e.g. +25 %).
- **Native**: no penalty for armies native to it, a penalty for everyone else.

Natives are defined per terrain in data (`TerrainDefinition`: class, base cost, native towns), not in
code, so new terrains and towns are content. Roads are a separate per-tile map layer (dirt 50, gravel 65,
cobblestone 75). Road cost replaces terrain cost, including native and rough penalties.

Consequences:
- The map format gains a road layer, with one character per tile like the terrain rows.
- Step cost depends on the hero's army, so `StepCost` takes the moving hero/army. Pathfinding stays
  per-hero.
- The random map generator lays roads between towns and through zone connections.

### ADR-025: Income comes only from sources; no base income
**Status**: accepted (2026-10-15)
The placeholder 500 gold per turn was removed. Daily income is the sum of pluggable `IIncomeSource`s
(`MineIncome` today; towns, Estates-like skills, hero specialisations and artifacts later), collected at
the start of the owner's turn. Nothing is published when the income is zero. New income features add a
source instead of editing `EconomyService`.

### ADR-026: Two-way and one-way gates, no random exits
**Status**: accepted (2026-10-15)
Two-way gates link a pair, on the same level or across levels (the former `SubterraneanGate`, now `TwoWayGate`).
One-way gates link an entrance to exactly one exit; several entrances may share an exit, and exits are
landing spots only. Random-exit portals are left out for now, so every link is fixed map data. That
keeps pathfinding exact and avoids hidden randomness. If they are added later, the exit must come from
the seeded game RNG and the pathfinder must stop at the entrance.
Implemented (2026-10-15) as planned: generalise `SubterraneanGate` into a two-way gate kind (subterranean gate and
two-way monolith become definitions), add `OneWayGateEntrance`/`OneWayGateExit` kinds, extend
`PathFinder` teleport edges to be directional, map format v3, and add an editor link tool and validation.

### ADR-027: Meeting heroes
**Status**: accepted (2026-10-15)
Stepping onto another hero's tile is an interaction, not a move: the moving hero stays where it is.
- Own hero: exchange (opened as a `PendingDecision`-style exchange session, resolved by the UI/AI).
- Enemy: battle (Phase 2).
- Ally: no interaction for now (blocked).

The pathfinder lets a route *end* on an own or visible enemy hero, never pass through. This needs
**teams/alliances** in `GameState` (player → team) so "ally" is defined; free-for-all is the default
(every player their own team).

### ADR-028: Town groups are lore and campaign only
**Status**: accepted (2026-10-15)
The four town groups carry no gameplay rules in standard or random-map games: no automatic alliances,
shared skills, diplomacy or group bonuses. Teams come from game setup (ADR-027); native terrain is
per town (ADR-024). Groups are used by the campaign (story, scripted alliances and events) and as
content filters (setup screens, random map templates). `Group` stays on the town definition as metadata.

### ADR-029: Town rivalries do not affect combat
**Status**: accepted (2026-10-15)
Rivalries such as Haven vs Necropolis are story and campaign material only. The combat engine has no
hate/enmity bonuses and no alignment or group modifiers. Creature abilities key off creature
*properties* (tags such as `Undead`, `Flying`, `Large`), never off town or group identity. This keeps
balance independent of pairings and lets any town be designed and balanced on its own.

### ADR-030: Five creature tiers, choose 7 of 9 dwellings
**Status**: accepted (2026-10-15); open details in game-design §4.3
Creatures have 5 tiers. Every playable town offers 9 dwellings: 2 alternatives at each of tiers 1–4
and 1 at tier 5. A town builds at most 7, at least one per tier, giving 7 creature types to match 7 army
slots, and making town builds a strategic choice. All playable-town creatures are upgradeable;
neutrals and the non-playable towns may not be. Data model: a town definition lists dwellings
`(tier, creature, upgradedCreature?)`. Build validation enforces the limits so the AI, the editor
(pre-built towns) and random maps share one rule. The constraint is "≤ 7 built, ≥ 1 per tier as the
goal": a town can be mid-build with fewer.
- Final per town: no demolition; the unbuilt alternatives are locked once 7 are built. The build
  validator must also refuse a build that would leave a tier impossible to fill. Example: with 6
  built and tier 3 still empty, only a tier-3 dwelling may be built.
- One upgrade building per dwelling; stacks can be upgraded in a town with that upgrade.
- Creatures from unbuilt dwellings remain available from map dwellings and other towns.
- Neutral creatures share the 1–5 tier scale (`CreatureDefinition.Tier`); `Upgrade` is optional.

### ADR-031: Refog behaviour: auto-stop, ambush, last-known objects
**Status**: accepted (2026-10-15)
In `ShroudWithRefog`:
- `MoveAlong` stops after a step when a previously unseen enemy hero comes into sight
  (new `MoveResult.EnemySpotted`).
- Bumping into an unseen enemy hero starts a battle (ambush) instead of returning `Occupied`.
- Players see the **last known state** of out-of-sight objects. Each player keeps a per-object
  snapshot (owner, present/removed), refreshed when the object is in sight. Views read that snapshot,
  never live state, for objects out of sight.

### ADR-032: Teams, native terrain, Pathfinding, roads
**Status**: accepted (2026-10-15)
- Teams: maps/templates define default teams; setup may change them unless the map locks them.
  Stored in `GameState` (player → team id) and map player slots.
- Terrain: three new native terrains: **highlands** (Haven), **forest floor** (Sylvan), **wasteland**
  (Necropolis). Each needs a terrain code, colour and editor brush. A terrain is native to an army
  only if **every** creature in it belongs to that terrain's town.
- The Pathfinding skill reduces non-native and rough penalties by 25/50/75 %.
- Roads: the road cost applies only road → road (HoMM3).

### ADR-033: Combat baseline: Tactics width choice, HoMM3 damage, cover
**Status**: accepted (2026-10-15)
- Battlefield 24 tall. The side with effective Tactics (own level − enemy level) picks the width before
  battle: Basic {30, 32}, Advanced {28, 30, 32}, Expert {28, 30, 32, 34}; otherwise 30. 36 is reserved
  for sieges. This refines ADR-021.
- Damage uses the HoMM3 formula as a baseline (+5 %/point Attack over Defense, cap +300 %;
  −2.5 %/point Defense over Attack, cap −70 %). Rolls come from the seeded battle RNG.
- Cover: any unit (friend or foe) or obstacle on the line of fire reduces ranged damage. The flat
  −25 % is superseded by ADR-035.

### ADR-034: Scope: slice towns, platforms, modding, tooling, random-map features
**Status**: accepted (2026-10-15)
- Vertical slice towns: **Haven and Inferno**.
- Treasure chests roll HoMM3-style tiers using the seeded game RNG; map authors may fix values.
- Mines may carry an optional guard; after the guard is beaten, any hero re-flags by visiting.
- Platforms for 1.0: Windows, Linux/Steam Deck. macOS later.
- Player modding is not a 1.0 requirement; formats stay data-driven and versioned anyway.
- Harness: the Godot 2D viewer plus a headless .NET simulator (`EternalWars.Tools.Sim`) for scripted
  scenarios, AI-vs-AI and RMG batch validation in CI.
- Random maps for 1.0: mirrored/symmetric templates and saving generated maps. No water/islands and no
  HotA template import.

### ADR-035: Cumulative ranged cover
**Status**: accepted (2026-10-15); supersedes the flat cover value in ADR-033
Every blocker on the line of fire between shooter and target adds a penalty, counted once per blocker:
2×2/3×3 creature 1/8, 4×4 creature 1/4, small obstacle 1/8, big obstacle 1/4, city wall 1/2.
Penalties add up and ranged damage is multiplied by (1 − total). Above 7/8 the shot is not allowed.
Penalties are exact eighths, so they are stored as integer eighths (`CoverEighths`) to keep battle
maths integer and deterministic. Units of either side count; the shooter and target never do.
Obstacle definitions carry a cover class (small/big/wall).
